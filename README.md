# Automated-Email-Responder-Agent
LLM-powered agent to classify emails, generate replies, and allow feedback. 
Sure! Here's the **entire `README.md` content** in a **single code block** for easy copy-paste into your GitHub repository:

This project is developed as part of an AI/ML Internship Assessment. It is a smart email responder web application built using modern AI techniques. The application automatically classifies email content uploaded in `.csv` format and suggests intelligent replies. It also offers a feedback mechanism to improve the suggested replies. 

 It uses **LLM-based classification** (via Hugging Face Transformers) and is built using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.

##  Problem Statement

- Many professionals receive large volumes of emails daily, making it hard to respond in a timely manner.
- Manually writing personalized replies is time-consuming and often repetitive.
- This project aims to solve the problem by automatically classifying emails and drafting smart, context-aware responses using machine learning models.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Jinja templates)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI/ML**: Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn
- **Other**: Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter for initial model experimentation

---

##  Solution Architecture

1. Users upload a `.csv` file containing email text.
2. The Flask server processes the file and sends each email through a pre-trained transformer model for classification.
3. Based on the category, a smart reply is generated and displayed.
4. Users can give feedback or edit the suggested reply.
5. The output is saved and can be downloaded as a result file.

## ðŸ“¬ Final Note

This project highlights my ability to work across the full ML lifecycle â€” from problem understanding and model selection to deployment and clean UI design. It is one example of how I bring together AI/ML skills and end-to-end project thinking to solve real-world problems effectively.
