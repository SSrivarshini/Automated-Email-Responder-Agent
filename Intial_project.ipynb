# 1. Load your dataset CSV 
df = pd.read_csv('email_dataset.csv')

# 2. Initialize zero-shot classification pipeline (uses a pretrained model)
classifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model='facebook/bart-large-mnli')

# 3. Define candidate labels (categories)
candidate_labels = ['spam', 'inquiry', 'complaint', 'support']

# 4. Define simple responses for each category
