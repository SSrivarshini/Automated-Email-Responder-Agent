"""
This module contains a helper function to load the Hugging Face zero-shot
classification model.

This code is extracted from the original app.py source code to improve
reusability and scalability by modularizing model loading.

The model used is "facebook/bart-large-mnli", which is dynamically loaded
from Hugging Faceâ€™s model hub when the Flask app runs. No local model files
are stored in this repository.

To change or update the model, modify the 'model_name' parameter in the
'get_classifier()' function below.
